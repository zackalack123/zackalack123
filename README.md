- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zackalack123
I am just starting out in learining how to code, primarially in Python. I have some previous Java experience from college but i'm trying to self-teach myself to challenge and advance myself
I am looking for smaller programs to learn the basics and how exactly all these programs work
If you, reading this have any tips or tricks that I havn't watched ed nauseum on youtube, feel free to help out!
